//In order to turn all these mathematical basics into a cryptosystem, some parameters have to be defined that are sufficient to do meaningful operations. There are 6 distinct values for the Fp case and they comprise the so-called "domain parameters":

// `p`: The prime number which defines the field in which the curve operates `Fp`. All point operations are taken modulo `p`.

// `a`, `b`: The two coefficients which define the curve. These are integers.

// `G`: The generator or base point. A distinct point of the curve which resembles the "start" of the curve. This is either given in point form `G` or as two separate integers `gx` and `gy`

// `n`: The order of the curve generator point `G`. This is, in layman's terms, the number of different points on the curve which can be gained by multiplying a scalar with `G`. For most operations this value is not needed, but for digital signing using ECDSA the operations are congruent modulo `n`, not `p`.

// `h`: The cofactor of the curve. It is the quotient of the number of curve-points, or #E(Fp), divided by n.
