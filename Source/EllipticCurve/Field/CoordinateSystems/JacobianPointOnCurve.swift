/// Jacobian Coordinates are used to represent elliptic curve points on prime curves y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. They give a speed benefit over Affine Coordinates when the cost for field inversions is significantly higher than field multiplications. In Jacobian Coordinates the triple (X, Y, Z) represents the affine point (X / Z^2, Y / Z^3).
/// Also known as `ProjectiveCoordinates`?: https://www.nayuki.io/res/elliptic-curve-point-addition-in-projective-coordinates/ellipticcurve.py
